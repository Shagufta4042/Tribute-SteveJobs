                <h2>His struggle </h2>
               <p>As he grew up, Jobs developed a strong distaste for formal education. He never really enjoyed school. Eventually, he went to college but dropped out after the first semester.</p>

               <p> But he continued attending the classes that interested him. One of them was calligraphy. He later said of the course.</p>
               <p><em>"If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts."</em></p>
                
               <p>He got a job at a video game manufacturing company, Atari. He saved up and headed to India with a friend for ‘spiritual enlightenment’. They stayed for 7 months, traveling around in buses between Delhi, UP and Himachal Pradesh.
                
                There, Jobs studied Eastern religion and returned home as a Buddhist. He had completely transformed as a person. He shaved his head and wore traditional Indian clothing.</p>
            <p>But Jobs wasn’t done experimenting. He then turned to psychedelic drugs for further exploration of the mind.</p>
            <p>After this phase of his life,came an invetors phase.Steve Jobs commenced a revolutionary collaboration with Steve Wozniak.They started with the ‘blue box’; a digital device that could be used to make long distance calls for free. 
                Its success became their motivation to take on big companies with their inventions.This led to the birth of the first-ever Apple machine.</p>
                <p>He chased investors till Intel agreed to fund them. Soon, Apple started making news and Jobs broke into Silicon Valley with a big bang.</p>
                <p><u>Jobs was worth $1 million when he was 23, $10 million at 24 and crossed $100 million by the time he was 25.He was the one of the youngest people to be featured 
                    on the Forbes list of the country’s richest people; a big feat without inheriting any family wealth.</u></p>
                    <p>Then came the biggest setback of Jobs’ career.After an internal discussion, he was fired from the Macintosh group. The decision was made after Pepsi Executive John Sculley encouraged the board to do so.
                         Ironically, Jobs had recently hired Sculley.Despite the shocking betrayal, Jobs didn’t give up.</p>
                         <p>He went on to establishing his new company, NeXT, but couldn’t boost sales due to the high prices of the machines.Then,he invested in a startup called
                              Graphics Group, now known as Pixar.He initially put in his millions and the company’s instant success after the release of Toy Story paid back Jobs and how. 
                              He remained a majority shareholder in Pixar.</p>
                              <p>Everything was well. But suddenly, Jobs' life shattered completely. He was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer.Jobs famously declined any medical treatment and refused to see a doctor, turning instead to natural methods such as vegan diets, acupuncture and herbal juices to curb his illness. 
                                  It is said that his plan backfired, worsening his health fatally.</p>
                                  <p>After a few years, when Jobs could no longer function normally, he resigned from Apple, writing:</p>
                                  <p><b>"I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, 
                                    I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.”</b></p>
                                      <p>He passed away calmly, surrounded by family. His last words were <u>“Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.”</u></p>
